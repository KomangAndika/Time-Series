The investment bank derivatives pricing techniques will almost certainly concentrate on Monte Carlo Methods and Finite Difference Methods, both of which rely on knowledge of probability, statistics, numerical analysis and partial differential equations.

The main techniques of interest include [Multivariate Linear Regression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_linear_regression), [Logistic Regression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression), [Resampling Techniques](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resampling_%28statistics%29), [Tree-Based Methods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning) (including [Random Forests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest)), [Support Vector Machines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine) (SVM), [Principal Component Analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) (PCA), [Clustering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis) ([K-Means](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_algorithm), [Hierarchical](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering)), [Kernal Methods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_methods) and [Neural Networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network).

Coursera Free course:
- **[Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml)** by Andrew Ng - This course covers the basics of the methods I have briefly mentioned above. It has received high praise from individuals who have participated. It is probably best watched as a companion to reading ISL or ESL given above.
- **[Neural Networks fand Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning)** by deeplearning.ai - This course focuses primarily on neural networks, which have a long history of association with quantitative finance. If you wish to specifically concentrate on this area, then this course is worth taking a look at, in conjunction with a solid textbook on the area.

In the next article in the series we will be considering the topics of non-linear machine learning, mathematical optimisation, exchanges/market microstructure, portfolio theory and computer programming - all necessary areas of study for a prospective quantitative trading researcher.
